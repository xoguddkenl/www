                <dd> A brave and wise person who survived the drift of 227 days. Currently, he has settled in Canada, raised a family, and teaches Judaism at university.He constantly tries to talk in a long drift. Conversation with himself through the diary, with God through prayer, and with Richard Parker the Tiger (in other versions of the story, Richard Parker was a pie, so a conversation with Richard Parker is nothing more than a conversation with himself). It is also a process of true reflection, discovering some power within oneself. In the process, problems of faith, something spiritual, problems of life and death, problems of truth and fantasy, etc. are raised.

The confusion on the paper gave him the name of the hunter, but it does not lose the wild animal instinct until the end.Regarding the ending of the film, the original author Jan Mattel said, “It is not as vague as the ending of the novel, but the ending of this film raises important questions about the truth, perceptions and beliefs and the possibility that there may be another unexpected version of the story of Pi. "There is," he said, expressing his favor with the adaptation of this film.
